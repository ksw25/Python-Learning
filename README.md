3. [Context Manager](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/with-statement-in-python/): `with` statement in Python is used in exception handling to make the code cleaner and much more readable. It simplifies the management of common resources like file streams. The interface with `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` methods which provides the support of `with` statement in user defined objects is called Context Manager.
4. [Generators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generators-in-python/): A generator-function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the `yield` keyword rather than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.
